**Everything your DualSense can do, on Linux, without the cable.** OpenDS5
lets you shape your controller's adaptive triggers, haptics, audio, lighting,
and buttons from one app — while your games see a wired DualSense with all
its native features unlocked, even though you're playing over Bluetooth.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 **Wireless-to-wired bridge (via vds)** — play Bluetooth, look wired.
  Unlocks native DualSense features in games that normally demand a cable.
  OpenDS5 installs and manages vds for you, so this works out of the box.
- 🧪 **Trigger Lab** — design your own adaptive trigger effects with the full
  DualSense effect surface: constant resistance, weapon-style breaks,
  vibration, resistance ramps, and 10-zone custom curves. Live-preview
  everything on your controller.
- 🎯 **Per-game trigger profiles** — OpenDS5 detects the game you're running and
  applies your saved trigger effects automatically. Great for games with no
  native DualSense support.
- 📚 **Profile library** — browse and install community-made game profiles from
  inside the app. The library lives in its own repo
  ([OpenDS5-Profiles](https://github.com/LordVicky/OpenDS5-Profiles)), so new
  game profiles arrive without waiting for an app update. Import/export lets
  you share profiles as plain JSON files.
- 🔊 **Haptics & controller audio** — route sound to the controller's speaker
  and headphone jack, with haptic feedback support.
- 💡 **Lighting** — control the lightbar and player LEDs.
- 🎛️ **Button remapping, personas & chords** — remap buttons, save setups as
  switchable personas, and trigger actions with button combinations.
- 📦 **Painless install** — one AppImage. A first-launch setup wizard installs
  the kernel module and background service for you (one password prompt),
  with Secure Boot handled. See [Supported distros](#-supported-distros).

## 🔌 Why the "wired" part matters

Many games with native DualSense support (adaptive triggers, haptics,
controller audio) only enable those features when the controller is plugged
in over USB. Over plain Bluetooth you get a basic gamepad and nothing else.

With vds running under OpenDS5, your controller stays wireless but games see
a USB-connected DualSense. Native trigger effects, haptics, and speaker audio
in supported games just work — no cable.

## 🐧 Supported distros

OpenDS5 ships a small kernel module (`vds_hcd`, from vds) that it installs
through **DKMS** — your distro's standard mechanism for out-of-tree modules.
DKMS builds the module against your running kernel and automatically rebuilds
it on every future kernel update, so it keeps working after upgrades. The
setup wizard handles all of this; the table below shows what it does on each
platform:

| Distro | How the module is installed |
| --- | --- |
| **Fedora** | `dnf` installs `dkms` + `kernel-devel` (or `kernel-cachyos-devel` on COPR kernels), then DKMS builds the module |
| **Arch / CachyOS** | `pacman` installs `dkms` + headers matched to your kernel flavor (`linux-cachyos-headers`, `linux-zen-headers`, …); Clang/LTO kernels build with `LLVM=1` |
| **Debian / Ubuntu** | `apt` installs `dkms` + `linux-headers-$(uname -r)` |
| **openSUSE** | `zypper` installs `dkms` + `kernel-default-devel` |
| **Bazzite / Silverblue** | `rpm-ostree install dkms kernel-devel` layers the packages; one reboot, then re-run the wizard |
| **NixOS** | Declarative flake module — add `inputs.opends5.nixosModules.default`, enable `services.opends5`, then apply with `nixos-rebuild switch` |

On every DKMS platform the installer then registers the module source under
`/usr/src/`, builds it, and enables autoload — after that, kernel updates are
handled for you. **Secure Boot** is supported too: the module is signed with
DKMS's own MOK key, and if that key isn't enrolled yet the wizard walks you
through the one-reboot enrollment.

On anything else, the installer exits with a clear "unsupported" message —
see [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md) for manual steps.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Download the latest `OpenDS5.AppImage` from
   [Releases](../../releases) and make it executable.
2. Run it. The setup wizard shows exactly what it will install (DKMS kernel
   module, `vdsd` service, udev rules) and does it after one password prompt.
3. Pair your DualSense over Bluetooth and you're done.

> [!NOTE]
> Setup disables BlueZ's input plugin so vds can own the controller's
> Bluetooth HID channels — without this the system grabs the DualSense as a
> plain gamepad and OpenDS5 never sees it. The trade-off (an upstream vds
> limitation): **other Bluetooth input devices like keyboards and mice won't
> work while OpenDS5's driver stack is installed.** Revert anytime with
> `sudo /usr/share/opends5/override-bluetoothd.sh enable-input --restart`.

Prefer the terminal? `./OpenDS5.AppImage --install-system` does the same
setup. See [docs/INSTALLER.md](docs/INSTALLER.md) for per-platform details,
exit codes, and logs.

## ⚙️ How it works

For the current component boundaries and runtime data flow, see the
[architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md), which records the
accepted target architecture for the ongoing refactor. Until later steps
land, the behavior described below remains current. The
[Nix packaging guide](docs/architecture/nix-packaging.md) records the accepted
target ownership design for ongoing packaging work; the installer and flake
behavior described below remains current until that work lands. The
historical [porting plan](docs/PORTING.md) remains available for background on
the original DS5 Bridge migration.

OpenDS5 stands on the shoulders of some great projects:

- [**DS5Dongle**](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle) by
  [awalol](https://github.com/awalol) pioneered the whole idea: firmware that
  turns a Pico 2 W into a DualSense dongle, making a wireless controller
  appear wired to the host. It's the foundation everything else here traces
  back to.
- [**DS5_Bridge**](https://github.com/SundayMoments/DS5_Bridge) by
  [SundayMoments](https://github.com/SundayMoments) built a Windows companion
  GUI on top of DS5Dongle, and it's where OpenDS5 began. We ported it to
  Linux, swapped the Pico hardware for vds, and then kept building on that
  foundation — a trigger effect designer, per-game profiles, a community
  profile library, and a one-click installer.
- [**vds**](https://github.com/hurryman2212/vds) by
  [hurryman2212](https://github.com/hurryman2212) is the breakthrough that
  brought all of this to Linux. Where DS5Dongle needed a Pico plugged into
  the machine, vds does the same job entirely in software: a kernel module
  and daemon that pick up your Bluetooth DualSense and present it to the
  system as a genuine USB-wired one. Before vds, none of this existed on
  Linux — every feature in OpenDS5 flows through it, and this project simply
  wouldn't exist without it.

## ⚠️ Honest limitations of custom trigger profiles

Custom profiles are powerful, but it's worth being clear about what they can
and can't do:

- **They react to your finger, not the game.** A profile can change the
  trigger feel based on how far you've pulled it (e.g. vibrate on full pull),
  but it has no idea what's happening in-game. It can't tell whether you're
  out of ammo, driving on gravel, or drawing a bow — only native game support
  can do that.
- **Don't stack them on natively supported games.** If a game already drives
  the triggers itself, a custom profile will fight it. For those games, let
  the game do the work — OpenDS5's wired bridge is what makes that possible.
- **State switching is inferred, not game-truth.** A profile can hold several
  named states ("Pistol", "Shotgun", "Driving") and switch between them when
  you press the game's own swap buttons — but OpenDS5 only sees your inputs,
  never the game. If the game blocks a swap (out of ammo, cutscene), the
  tracked state can drift; the state chips in the app and select-style rules
  re-sync it in one press.
- **Reactive effects need input access.** Modifiers that respond to trigger
  position read the controller's input device, which usually requires your
  user to be in the `input` group. Without it, the profile's base effect
  still works; only the reactive parts are skipped.
- **Some effect modes need a current `vdsd`.** The newer modes
  (`multi-feedback`, `slope`, `multi-vibration`, frequency-controlled
  `vibration`) use the V2 trigger command. If they do nothing, update the
  daemon with `./update-vdsd.sh`.

## 🤝 Contributing game profiles

Made a trigger profile you like? Export it from the app and open a PR against
[OpenDS5-Profiles](https://github.com/LordVicky/OpenDS5-Profiles) — one game
per PR, branch named after the game. CI validates profiles with the same
rules the app enforces, and merged profiles appear in everyone's in-app
library automatically.
