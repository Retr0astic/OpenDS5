Goal: run the DS5 Bridge companion experience on Linux with a
Bluetooth-connected DualSense, using vds (`vds_hcd.ko` + `vdsd`) as the
transport instead of the Pico 2 W dongle.

Upstream snapshots vendored here:

- `hurryman2212/vds` @ `1448bb8ef98c65b8962223889ea9441f921393a2`
- `SundayMoments/DS5_Bridge` @ `a8ec87d0fdb281d75e4bd5854d5b14d3aa05a3e4`

## Architecture decision

DS5 Bridge's companion app talks to the Pico over a **vendor HID / WinUSB
companion interface** (`companion/src/main/winusb-companion-transport.ts`,
protocol in `companion/src/shared/protocol.ts`). On Linux there is no Pico:
the controller is already exposed as a virtual USB DualSense by vds, and
`vdsd` owns the Bluetooth link.

The port therefore replaces the transport layer: implement a
**vdsd companion transport** in the Electron main process that speaks to
`vdsd` (extend vdsd with a local control socket / extend `vdsctl`'s IPC), and
map the companion protocol's commands (audio routing, haptics, trigger
effects, lightbar, remaps) onto DualSense output reports sent through vdsd.

## Windows-dependency inventory (companion app)

| File / area | Windows dependency | Linux replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main/winusb-companion-transport.ts` | WinUSB to Pico vendor interface | New `vdsd-companion-transport.ts` over a Unix domain socket to vdsd |
| `main/audio-helper.ts` + `native/AudioHelper/` | WASAPI audio sessions, endpoint mgmt, haptics mirroring | PipeWire (native module or `node-pipewire`); vds already ships a WirePlumber config |
| `main/pico-firmware-updater.ts`, `pico-universal-flash-nuke-hash.ts` | Pico BOOTSEL flashing | Drop (no hardware). Stub the firmware UI or hide behind a transport capability flag |
| `main/hid-discovery-client.ts` / `-worker.ts` | node-hid enumeration of Pico | Discover `/dev/vds*` nodes / query vdsd |
| `main/settings-store.ts`, tray/startup behavior | Windows paths, autostart | XDG paths, `.desktop` autostart entry |
| `shared/protocol.ts`, `shared/types.ts` | None (pure TS) | Reuse as-is |
| `renderer/` (React UI) | None significant | Reuse as-is; hide Pico-only panels via capability flags |

## vds-side work

- Add a companion control channel to `vdsd` (Unix socket, JSON commands —
  `vdsctl` already has a command surface to extend; see
  `vds/src/vdsctl_common.cc`).
- Expose the state the Overview page needs: connection health, battery,
  Bluetooth signal quality, active profile.
- vds explicitly does **not** support headset output / mic over Bluetooth
  (upstream README) — the Audio/mic pages must degrade gracefully; speaker
  and haptics-over-audio paths need investigation against
  `vds/include/vds/ds5_protocol.h`.

## Milestones

1. **M0 — build both upstreams** ✅: kernel module (DKMS), vdsd/vdsctl, and
   companion app all build; 216 upstream tests pass on Linux (Fedora with
   kernel-cachyos).
2. **M1 — transport swap** ✅: vdsd `companion` control command
   (`vds/src/vds_companion.cc`) emulates companion protocol 1.16;
   `VdsdCompanionTransport` + `openCompanionTransport()` factory in the app.
   Verified end-to-end against the live daemon.
3. **M2 — output features** ✅ (hardware-validated 2026-07-07: lightbar + rumble confirmed on a physical DualSense): companion settings
   actuate through `DsCompanionOverrides` layered onto `DsOutputState`
   (`vds/src/vds_protocol.cc`) — lightbar override/brightness, player LED,
   classic rumble gain + 650 ms rumble test, haptics gain (scales BT haptics
   samples), speaker volume, Trigger Lab apply/preview/test with
   firmware-identical zone encoding and 2.5 s test expiry driven by the epoll
   deadline.
4. **M3 — audio & haptics** ✅ (hardware-validated 2026-07-07):
   `companion/native/audio-helper-linux.mjs` implements the AudioHelper
   protocol over PipeWire — speaker test tone, haptics test pattern, and
   audio-reactive haptics (default-sink monitor → lowpass/envelope DSP →
   sink channels RL/RR; the pro-audio sink is FL,FR,RL,RR where the rear
   pair drives the actuators). Requires the card's pro-audio profile and
   the vds WirePlumber conf. Speaker + haptics + music-follow confirmed on
   hardware.
5. **M4 — input features** ✅ (hardware-validated 2026-07-07; personas stay
   DualSense-only pending kernel descriptor profiles):
   `companion_translate_input` in vds_companion.cc rewrites input reports in
   the daemon — 21-button remap table (hat re-encoding, analog trigger
   preservation) and chord detection (starter held + button, press-scoped
   suppression, event queue served via companion INPUT report 0x04). App-side
   chord actions run through wtype (keyboard) and playerctl/wpctl (media) on
   Linux.
6. **M5 — packaging**: AppImage/deb/Arch package, systemd + udev integration
   (vds ships `vdsd.service.in` and udev rules).

## Known risks

- Mic/headset audio is a hard limitation of Bluetooth HID transport per vds
  upstream — DS5 Bridge's mic feature likely cannot be ported 1:1.
- Personas beyond ds5/dse (DualShock 4, Xbox) would need new descriptor
  profiles in the vds kernel module.
- Kernel module API churn: vds targets mainline; verify against the running
  CachyOS kernel.
